What you did 
- form to submit habits
- very general, but accepts habit name and description
- no limitations in place, whatever is in the input gets added 
  to the habits
- useState for the list of habits, keeping track of new habit and desc
- input is controlled, source of truth is now the state 

To Do:
- definitely add limitations on the habit
- don't allow habits with the same name
- guess we can do the styling at the end
- we'll focus more on the functionality of the project
- still make that tierlist to familiarize yourself with beautiful DnD
- this will allow for drag and drop 
- once the habit is made, you should be able to edit the habit
